History of technique unification.

Many techniques.
Naked pairs, triples, quadruples, n-tuples
Hidden pairs, triples, quarduples, n-tuples
x-wing, swordfish, jellyfish
...

various i-tuples unified as n-tuples
naked and hidden n-tuples got recognized as two sides of the same coin

Common pattern noticed among n-tuples and other techniques: a set of regions had the set of all their 
elements be a proper subset of the set of all the elements of a set of the same number of other regions. 
Only the types of the regions differed depending on the technique.  N-fish paired rows and columns 
against each other. N-tuples paired cells in a box/column/row against the values of the puzzle. 

N-tuples and N-fish unify into Sledgehammer: Naked N-tuples' sources are cells; Hidden N-tuples' 
sources are rows/columns/boxes; N-fishes' sources are either rows or columns

Color chain, forcing chain, xy-chain, xy-wing, etc. unify into xor-chain analysis.

xor-chain analysis and sledgehammer unify because both are cases of en-masse brute force: Xor-chain 
implications manifest as a result of the overlap of the consequences of the two solution-states of 
a xor-chain. Sledgehammer scenarios always collapse the recipients' footprint down to the sources' 
footprint because any and all solutions of the set of sources will falsify all claims in recipients 
that are not also in sources.  (All possible solutions among such-and-such Facts force such-and-such 
Claims outside those Facts to necessarily be false.)
